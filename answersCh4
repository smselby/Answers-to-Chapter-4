For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].
	6.	What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

	7.	What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
Answer: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

	8.	What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

	16.	Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

	17.	What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
